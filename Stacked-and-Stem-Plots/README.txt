Exploring Stem and Stacked Plots

Welcome to the Stem and Stacked Plots exploration! This section of the Exploring Libraries repository is dedicated to learning how to create and customize stem and stacked plots using Matplotlib, a powerful plotting library in Python.

Introduction:

Matplotlib offers various types of plots for visualizing data, including stem and stacked plots, which are helpful in representing specific data structures.

Stem Plots: These plots are useful for visualizing discrete data points. They draw vertical lines from a baseline to the data points, with markers at the tips, making them ideal for plotting sequences of data.

Stacked Plots: Stacked plots help visualize parts of a whole over time or categories. They stack data series on top of each other, allowing you to see both the individual contribution and the total of several datasets.

This README will guide you through the basics of both plot types with examples.

Key Features of Stem Plots:

Discrete Data Representation: Ideal for sequences or time-series data.
Markers and Stems: Customize the appearance of both the vertical stems and the markers.
Control Baseline: Adjust where the baseline is drawn for better visual clarity.
Key Features of Stacked Plots:
Layered Data: Visualize multiple data series stacked on top of each other.
Proportional Representation: Useful for comparing different datasets in the same plot.
Horizontal and Vertical Stacking: Available for both bar charts and area plots.
Customizable Colors and Labels: Easily differentiate between different series using color and labels.
